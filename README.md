# pyQ3
Tools for interacting with DEW, EQPT, and EQ3, via python

The first step is to import DEW into ENKI by making phase objects for each DEW species. This is done in the import_DEW.ipnb notebook.

For demonstrations of how to create custom DATA0 files, and for running EQ3 calculations, see the notebooks in the tutorial folder.
