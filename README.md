Tools for interacting with DEW, EQPT, and EQ3, via python

The first step is to import DEW into ENKI by making phase objects for each DEW species. This is done in the import_DEW.ipnb notebook.

You can then import these objects into another notebook using ENKI modules. The python module DEW_tools allows interaction with EQ3 and EQPT. I've included the notebook I used to make the plots on my Goldschmidt poster. This won't run as it also requires other phase objects for Zr minerals and species, but it should work as a reference for how to get the module working.
